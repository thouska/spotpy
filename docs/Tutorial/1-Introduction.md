# Introduction

Before you start to use SPOTPY you should be familiar with Python. Otherwise I recommend you to read a [basic Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ " Basic Python tutorial") or [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/ "Think Python") first.

Basic knowledge about NumPy is also needed. You can get this [here](http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/numpy.pdf "NumPY tutorial").

Last but not least you will need to have knowledge about [Bayesian techniques](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/tree/master/ "Bayesian techniques").

You will find all the needed code to reproduce the following examples in the `PYTHONPATH/Lib/site-packages/spotpy/examples` folder.
