class mc(_algorithm):
    '''
    Implements the MonteCarlo algorithm.

    Input
    ----------
    spot_setup: class
        model: function 
            Should be callable with a parameter combination of the parameter-function
            and return an list of simulation results (as long as evaluation list)
        parameter: function
            When called, it should return a random parameter combination. Which can
            be e.g. uniform or Gaussian
        objectivefunction: function
            Should return the objectivefunction for a given list of a model simulation and
            observation.
        evaluation: function
            Should return the true values as return by the model.

    dbname: str
        * Name of the database where parameter, objectivefunction value and simulation results will be saved.

    dbformat: str
        * ram: fast suited for short sampling time. no file will be created and results are saved in an array.
        * csv: A csv file will be created, which you can import afterwards.
    parallel: str
        * seq: Sequentiel sampling (default): Normal iterations on one core of your cpu.
        * mpi: Message Passing Interface: Parallel computing on cluster pcs (recommended for unix os).

    save_sim: boolean
        *True:  Simulation results will be saved
        *False: Simulationt results will not be saved
