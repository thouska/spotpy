This class makes the MPI parallelization.

When an algorithm is constructed with parallel='mpi' the repeater of the algorithm as
a ForEach object from this package. The .start() method seperates one master process from
all the other processes that are used as workers. The master holds a list called "slots",
where the master notes which processes are busy with a job. When a new job should be sent to 
a worker, the master looks for a free slot and sends the job to the corresponding worker 
process.
