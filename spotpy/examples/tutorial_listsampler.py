    # 2.1 Lets assume something went wrong with the model or you want to use 
    # the same parameter set again. Then the list_sampler is what you need.
    # It is also thinkable that you want to change something in this database
    # and restart.
    # The list_sampler takes a spotpy database as input, reads the paramater 
    # in it and starts the model again:
    
    # 2.2 Use the generated database to reuse the parameters:
    sampler_new = spotpy.algorithms.list_sampler(spot_setup, dbname='FAST_hymod', dbformat='csv')
    
    # 2.3 Start the sampler with the according number of repetitions
    sampler_new.sample(rep)
    
    # 2.4 Load the result, the new database will have added the word "list"
    results = spotpy.analyser.load_csv_results('FAST_hymodlist')
    
    # 2.5 Please mind that these results contains the same data as we have used 
    # the same spot_setup. However we could have also used another spot_setup, 
    # which takes the same parameters.
