                Should be callable with a parameter combination of the parameter-function
                and return an list of simulation results (as long as evaluation list)
            parameter: function
                When called, it should return a random parameter combination. Which can
                be e.g. uniform or Gaussian
            objectivefunction: function
                Should return the objectivefunction for a given list of a model simulation and
                observation.
            evaluation: function
                Should return the true values as return by the model.

        dbformat: str
            * ram: fast suited for short sampling time. no file will be created and results are saved in an array.
            * csv: A csv file will be created, which you can import afterwards.

            * seq: Sequentiel sampling (default): Normal iterations on one core of your cpu.
